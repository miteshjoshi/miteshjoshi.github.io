Hello, Mitesh Joshi here. Thanks for visiting my page. <br/><br/>
 
About me:<br/>
I'm  Software Engineer @ ThoughtSpot.<br/> 

My professional interest lies in Software Design, Large Scale Software Development, Distributed Systems, Application Security, SaaS,
and Algorithms.<br/><br/>
Particular about each of the interests:
<br/>
Software Design: 
- Doing the pragmatic design with right set of trade-off influenced by X, Y, Z

<br/>
Large Scale Software Development
- Mostly it's service oriented architecture based on micro-services that shares shared reason of logic.
- Orchestration and Choreography based systems.
- Keeping data consistent and doing parallel development and deployment without worrying rolling out features and sharing code.

<br/>
Distributed Systems:
- System with HA

<br/><br/>
SaaS:<br/>
- Multi-tenancy (Economy of scale)<br/>
- Pricing<br/>
- Control-plane and data-plane design<br/>
- AuthZ and AuthN<br/>

<br/>
Algorithms: <br/>
- Programming puzzles and hard-core datastructure that power modern day distributed systems and data storage. <br/>
<br/>
Leading and making team fullfilled and productive:<br/>
- Idea is to have fun and be productive and do best work of your life.

Personal interest and activities that I indulge in: <br/>
- Running (who doesn't like a daily dose of andorphins and upbeat music) <br/> 
- Yoga (I'm nothing but flexible. :p ) <br/>
- Cooking(motto here why can't healthy food be tasty as well.) <br/>
